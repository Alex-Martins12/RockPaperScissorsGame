# Rock Paper Scissors Game
 Project of a simple rock paper scissors game with JavaScript
 
 I didn't write this code on my own! There is a tutorial on youtube on how to do it. 
 But I did some changes to it:
 
* Now the message changes according to what the computer and user picked!
* I also added a translation feature, now you can change the language to Brazilian Portuguese and English
